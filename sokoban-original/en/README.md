# Original Sokoban port
The Sokoban game first appeared on the Nec PC-8801 computer.
To my great disappointment, it was never ported to the PC-8001, so I tried to do it myself.
Now I understand why they didn't rewrite it.
In addition to the PC-8001's modest graphics capabilities, its special screen management made coding the game very difficult. Nevertheless, I tried to keep the original program codes, even if they were far from optimal and efficient.
Keyboard handling is tragic on the PC-8001, so the backspace function is sorely missed. Nevertheless, I hope the program will still provide a useful time travel experience for those who, like me, only have a PC-8001 and do not have a PC-8801.
Enjoy the game! :)
